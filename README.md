# pyaerocom-examples

Short usage examples for pyaerocom. The examples are either provided as python scripts (.py files) or as jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files).

Taking an optimistic approach, it can be expected that this repository will be filled with a lot of examples in the following months, so it makes sense to organize a little, how to structure these examples to keep an overview.

## How to name the example files

Example code files may be either jupyter notebooks or python scripts (.py files). The following naming convention should be applied all examples found in the toplevel directory:

*ex_<YYYYMMDD>_<user>_<short_string_describing_what_this_is_about>.py*

For instance

*ex_20200121_jonasg_check_access_lustre.ipynb*
